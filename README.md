Building a Raspberry Pi HQ camera module into a pistol grip chassis

The pistol grip screw cap uses the necks and caps library by Xavan, under a CC BY 4.0 licence, from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1654620

camera.scad is the master file.

At its centre is a triangular chassis, on the front of which fits the camera module. The sloping top is designed to mount a Raspberry Pi in a case using Velcro strips. On the sides and bottom are slide mounts for handles or other fixings, these can be found in slide-locating.scad. These mounts work, but still need some tolerance tweaking to be perfect.

There is an oversized pistol grip handle designed to take two 18650 cells in holders, it has a screw cap on the bottom.
